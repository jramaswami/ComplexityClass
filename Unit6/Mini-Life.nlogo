## Conway's Game of Life, only smaller
This is a simplified version of what is probably the most famous cellular automaton, invented by Cambridge mathematician John H. Conway around 1970. Unlike the _real_ Game of Life, which takes place on an infinite plane, this version only supports a fixed number of cells. By default, the 'world' grid is wrapped into a torus shape.

## How it works
An _additive_ cellular automaton rule counts the number of neighborhood cells in a particular state. The rule which Conway defined is an additive rule for cells with two states (here, "black" and "white", or "live" and "dead"). These cells inhabit a square grid, where a cell's neighborhood includes its eight horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors.

> Where _n_ is the **number of black cells** in the cell's outer 8-neighborhood:
> 
>    A black cell remains black on the next step
>    only if _n_ = 2 or _n_ = 3, otherwise becoming white;
>
>   A white cell becomes black on the next step
>    only if _n_ = 3, otherwise remaining white

This model is a fairly simple and direct implementation in NetLogo, using round turtles for cells. It includes rudimentary pattern editing and randomization features, but it is mostly intended to be easy to use and easy to understand, rather than fast or featureful.

## Some basic questions to get started:
Try a few simple initial patterns of cells. How many generations does it take before they stabilize into a 'still life'? Are there any initial patterns which never become stable or settle into an oscillating _cycle_? Can you find a cyclic pattern which moves across the grid? Can you find a small initial pattern which grows to fill the entire space? Why do we need two half-steps to compute one generation --- what would happen if cells changed their colors immediately upon counting their neighbors?

## Need more room?
You can increase the NetLogo 'world size', and the model will still work without being wrapped around at the edges. But Complexity Explorer also provides a full-sized Game of Life implementation, with more features and more background information. You'll probably want to move up to that model when you feel like you understand this one.
