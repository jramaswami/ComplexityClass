# Introduction

NetLogo models for homework for Unit 7 of the Introduction to Complexity Class
offered by Complexity Explorer at www.complexityexplorer.org.

# Intermediate/Advanced Homework

The NetLogo models JR_Fireflies.nlogo and JR_Flocking.nlogo are the models
written for the intermediate/advanced homework of unit 7.  They are my
attempt to code from scratch models found in the NetLogo Models library.

# Very Advanced Level

The NetLogo model AntsForagingWithoutSpatialInformation.nlogo is my attempt
to model the ant behavior described in *The Regulation of Ant Colony Foraging 
Activity without Spatial Information* by Balaji Prabhakar, Katherine N. 
Dektar, and Deborah M. Gordon.

# To Download Models

I had some problems when I tried to download NetLogo models from github.
Here is how I was able to download them and get them working.

1. Click on the model you want to download.  
2. Click on the "Raw" button.
3. Save the resulting page.
4. You should be able to open the downloaded in NetLogo and run it.
