# Introduction

NetLogo models for homework for Unit 7 of the Introduction to Complexity Class
offered by Complexity Explorer at www.complexityexplorer.org.

# Intermediate/Advanced Homework

The NetLogo models JR_Fireflies.nlogo and JR_Flocking.nlogo are the models
written for the intermediate/advanced homework of unit 7.  They are my
attempt to code from scratch models found in the NetLogo Models library.

# Very Advanced Level

The NetLogo model AntsForagingWithoutSpatialInformation.nlogo is my attempt
to model the ant behavior described in *The Regulation of Ant Colony Foraging 
Activity without Spatial Information* by Balaji Prabhakar, Katherine N. 
Dektar, and Deborah M. Gordon.
